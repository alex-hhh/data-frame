;; Both `lower-bound` and `upper-bound` will search a sorted vector, VEC for a
;; value VAL and return an index into the vector.  The vector is assumed to
;; contain sorted values, as defined by CMP-FN (which must define a strict
;; ordering, that is a "less than" operation, BUT NOT a "less than or equal"
;; operation).  KEY, if present, selects the value to compare (useful if the
;; vector contains structures and we want to search on a structure slot).
;; START and END define the sub-range of the vector to search.
;;
;; If unsure, you need to use `lower-bound`
;;
;; `lower-bound` will return an index identifying the earliest position where
;; VAL could be inserted to keep the range sorted, while upper-bound will
;; return the last position where an insertion would keep the value sorted.
;;
;; * if VAl exists one or more times in the vector, `lower-bound` will return
;; the first occurrence, but `upper-bound` will return one after the last
;; occurrence.  For example:
;;
;;     (define data (vector 1 2 3 4 5))
;;     (lower-bound data 3) => 2 (position of '3' is at index 2)
;;     (upper-bound data 3) => 3
;;
;;     (define data (vector 1 2 3 3 3 4 5))
;;     (lower-bound data 3) => 2 (first '3' is at index 2)
;;     (upper-bound data 3) => 5 (NOTE: at index 5 we have the value '4')
;;
;; * if VAL is smaller than the first value in the range, both functions
;; return START
;;
;; * if VAL is greater than the last value in the range, both functions return
;; END (this is considered out of range for the vector)
;;
;; * If VAL does not exist, an index is returned representing the location of
;; VAL in the vector (or the "best" location, if val is not found).  Same
;; index is returned by both functions.
;;
;; To determine if a value actually exists in a vector you also need to check
;; the actual value at the position returned by `lower-bound`, like so:
;;
;; (define (exists? data v)
;;   (define index (lower-bound data v))
;;   (and (< index (vector-length data))
;;        (equal? v (vector-ref data index))))
;;
;; NOTE: this works like the std::lower_bound() and std::upper_bound()
;; functions in C++.
