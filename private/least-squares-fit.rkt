;;         fitted.  The degree of the polynomial is specified by the DEGREE
;;         parameter, by default this is 2
;;
;; 'exponential or 'exp -- a function of Y = a * e ^ (b * X) + c is fitted.
;;         Note that this fit is not very good, and annealing needs to be used
;;         to improve it (see below)
;;
;; 'logarithmic or 'log -- a function of type Y = a + b * ln(X) is fitted.
;;         This will only return a "real" fit function (as opposed to an
;;         imaginary one) if all values in YSERIES are positive

;; RESIDUAL? when #t indicates that the residual value is also returned in the
;; `least-squares-fit` structure.  Setting it to #f will avoid some

;;
;; ANNEALING? when #t indicates that the fit coefficients should be further
;; refined using the `annealing` function.  This is only used for 'exponential
;; or 'power fit functions as these ones do not produce "best fit"
;; coefficients -- I don't know why, I am not a mathematician, I only used the
